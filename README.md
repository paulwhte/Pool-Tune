# Pool-Tune
<h3>A no nonsense pool chemistry recording app</h3>

<p>
  This app is meant to be a mostly standalone tool for keeping track of the chemical levels of a pool.<br>
  Problems with existing apps include: 
  <li>Paywalls for holding more than one record (Pool Math)</li>
  <li>Tech bloat like photo submissions introducing annoying bugs (Clorox Pool Care, many others)</li>
  <li>Problems running on different devices</li>
  <li>In-app marketing or required registration that induces email marketing</li>
  
  <br><br>
  <b>Goals:</b>
  <li>&#9745;Basically unlimited number of records for free (local storage)</li>
  <li>&#9745;Quick view of the last measurement for every level</li>
  <li>&#9745;History viewable in table or graph form with ability to choose date range</li>
  <li>Import and export of JSON files for backup to google drive or other to prevent data loss</li>
  <li>Slick, minimal appearance and good QOL without overfilling the screen</li>

  <br><br>

  <b>Technologies used so far:</b>
  <li>Angular JS for the main function of the app</li>
  <li>A bit of Typescript to help with the data structure</li>
